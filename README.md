## FAQ

### Q: How can I add icon to menu / content?
A: We use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) in this theme. Then you can add tag such as <code>**&lt;i class="fa fa-star"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;**</code> in front of your menu title, or in post's "Text Tab" and you will get "star" icon.
You can find all icons [here](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).
