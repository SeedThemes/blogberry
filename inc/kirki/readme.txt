Tired of all the bloated options frameworks? You can use the WordPress Customizer instead, and extend it using Kirki!

== Description ==

Kirki allows developers to add advanced controls to their customizer as well as customize the way the customizer looks and feels.

The following controls are included:

* Buttonset
* Checkbox
* Color
* Image
* Background
* Image Radio
* Multicheck
* Radio
* Select
* Slider
* Text
* Textarea
* Upload

For documentation and examples on how to use these controls, please visit [kirki.org](http://kirki.org/#fields).

In addition you can also automatically generate the CSS for a lot of controls and have it added to the head of your document without writing any custom functions and code for that. [Learn more about automatic output of CSS here](http://kirki.org/#output)

== Installation ==
